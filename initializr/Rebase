inally, git rebase is pretty cool. Anything you’ve changed by committing to your current branch but are no in the upstream are saved to a temporary area, so your branch is the same as it was before you started your changes, IE, clean. It then grabs the latest version of the branch from the remote If you do ‘git pull –rebase’, git will pull down the remote changes, rewind your local branch, then replays all your changes over the top of your current branch one by one, until you’re all up to date. Awesome huh?
